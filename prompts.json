This is in order to maximize the use of the free cores allocated to the preview. As a result, you are only allowed to run a given deployment continuously for 48 hours, after which time it will be shut down.    \nIf you see this happen, you can validate that the system shut it down by running the az mesh app show command in the Azure CLI. Check to see if it returns \"\"status\"\": \"\"Failed\"\", \"\"statusDetails\"\": \"\"Stopped resource due to max lifetime policies for an application during preview. Delete the resource to continue.\"\"    \nFor example:    \ncli    \n    \n    ~$ az mesh app show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name helloWorldApp  \n    {  \n      \"\"debugParams\"\": null,  \n      \"\"description\"\": \"\"Service Fabric Mesh HelloWorld Application!\"\",  \n      \"\"diagnostics\"\": null,  \n      \"\"healthState\"\": \"\"Ok\"\",  \n      \"\"id\"\": \"\"/subscriptions/1134234-b756-4979-84re-09d671c0c345/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ServiceFabricMesh/applications/helloWorldApp\"\",  \n      \"\"location\"\": \"\"eastus\"\",  \n      \"\"name\"\": \"\"helloWorldApp\"\",  \n      \"\"provisioningState\"\": \"\"Succeeded\"\",  \n      \"\"resourceGroup\"\": \"\"myResourceGroup\"\",  \n      \"\"serviceNames\"\": [  \n        \"\"helloWorldService\"\"  \n      ],  \n      \"\"services\"\": null,  \n      \"\"status\"\": \"\"Failed\"\",  \n      \"\"statusDetails\"\": \"\"Stopped resource due to max lifetime policies for an application during preview.

Purchased 2019 Office and tried to connect Outlook to our on-premises Exchange Server 2016.  Anyway, entered his information to get outlook setup, and all it does it continuously ask for the password over and over and I cannot get past it.  No error message, nothing in event viewer.  Thinking it was the new laptop, I fired up a virtual machine with Window 11.  Amazingly enough, same problem, continuous request for the password, regardless of the \"\"remember\"\" setting.  Thinking it was Windows 11, fired up a virtual windows 10 machine, and same problem, endless password request.  I had just rebuilt a win10 machine a month ago and had no problems logging in, so I joined the test win 10 to the domain, logged in and Outlook setup like a charm.  Joined the Windows 11 machine to the domain, same, Outlook logged in.      \nQuestion is, what do I have to change on the exchange server to allow a non-domain computer to have outlook connect to it.    \nMicrosoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer only complains about the ssl certificate (only 7 employee's, no need for the premium certificate).
